      <dt>Your ☠ site doesn't work with [not Firefox]</dt>
      <dd>Short answer: we don't care.</dd>

      <dt>Where is the form to send my favorite loli cry?</dt>
      <dd>There isn't, but you can contact us through IRC (see page footer) and
          we can then agree with various ways to share files.</dd>

      <dt>Why don't you just add a ☠ form?</dt>
      <dd>We hate all web-related development and actually already failed to do that.</dd>
      <dd>Also, after one year, no one ever tried to make a single cry, so we just don't care.</dd>
      <dd>And finally, we just don't want to have complicated setup on server-side. Let's

      <dt>You guys are awesome, I want to help you the hard way</dt>
      <dd>Then you can start by cloning the
          <a href="https://github.com/ubitux/loliscree.ch">public repository on
          github</a>, hack it like a boss (loli add/edit, CSS improvements, …),
          commit your awesome stuff and request a merge.</dd>

      <dt>How do I extract my favorite loli shout?</dt>
      <dd>If you are running Linux, it's quite easy. Just use the following
          command: <samp>ffmpeg -i My-great-anime.avi -vn -ss 14:22.4 -t
          00:00:03.230 -aq 7 -ac 2 -acodec libvorbis -y out.ogg</samp> and that's
          all. <code>-ss</code> and <code>-t</code> are timestamps following
          the <code>hh:mm:ss.ms</code> format.</dd>
      <dd>You can use whichever method you like (or can use) as soon as you
          ouput an Ogg/Vorbis file.</dd>
      <dd>Note: if the video has multiple audio streams and the japanese one
          isn't selected, what you're searching for is certainly the
          <code>-map</code> option.</dd>

      <dt>How do I extract my favorite loli pic?</dt>
      <dd>On Linux – yeah, again – it's quite easy. You can use: <samp>
          ffmpeg -i My-great-anime.avi -ss 1094.1 -r 1 -f image2
          My-great-anime.png</samp>
      </dd>

      <dt>How do I convert my loli pic to the right resolution?</dt>
      <dd>Linux answer, use <cite>ImageMagick</cite>: <samp>mogrify -resize 300x200
      My-great-anime.png</samp></dd>
